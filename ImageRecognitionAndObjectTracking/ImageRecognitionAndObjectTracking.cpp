// Image Recognition and Object Detection : Part 1 - http://www.learnopencv.com/image-recognition-and-object-detection-part1/ 
/*
In this part, we will briefly explain image recognition using traditional computer vision techniques. I refer to techniques 
that are not Deep Learning based as traditional computer vision techniques because they are being quickly replaced by Deep 
Learning based techniques. That said, traditional computer vision approaches still power many applications. Many of these 
algorithms are also available in computer vision libraries like OpenCV and work very well out of the box.

We will learn about these in later posts, but for now keep in mind that if you have not looked at Deep Learning based image recognition 
and object detection algorithms for your applications, you may be missing out on a huge opportunity to get better results.
